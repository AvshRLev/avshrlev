## About

I am a junior fullstack developer with a DevOps orientation, experienced in end-to-end development of Python/JavaScript web apps.
I was mentored to use best practices and clean code principles to produce high quality and maintainable code.

I get along great with people and love working in a team.
In my spare time I love hiking and I weave baskets.
